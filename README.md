# Detection-of-epilepsy-using-EEG-signals

## Description

The aim of this project is to detect the epilepsy disease which is a neurological disorder. Epilepsy is classified into three categories normal,interictal,and ictal.
Generally it will take a lot of time to find this disease but with the technology improvement it allows us to find things easily with less duration of time so i built CNN,LSTM and an hybrid model(CNN+LSTM) to classify the categories of Epilepsty.

## Dataset Credits

The EEG data used in this project was sourced from the University of Bonn EEG dataset. We would like to acknowledge and thank the University of Bonn for providing this valuable dataset.
